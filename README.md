# Guess-The-Number

A simple Python-based number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The program provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, and counts the number of attempts taken by the user to guess correctly.

## How to Play

1. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
2. The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the program provides feedback:
   - "Lower number please" if the guess is too high.
   - "Higher number please" if the guess is too low.
4. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
5. The program displays the correct number and the total number of attempts made by the user.

## Example
Guess the number: 50<br><br>
**Lower number please<br>**
Guess the number: 30<br><br>
**Higher number Please<br>**
Guess the number: 40<br>
You have guessed the number 40 correctly in 3 attempts
